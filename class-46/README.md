# Week 9 Feedback Review

## The Good/Most Helpful

- Serious outpouring of love for instructional staff
  - the pleasure is ours, y'all
- The "ramp-down" feeling/"chill" new topics
  - that's intentional!
  - "... reinforced the fact that we now have the knowledge to do pretty much whatever we want" 100%

## The Constructive/Least Helpful

- Wishing for a little more practical Play Store deployment info
  - A reasonable wish! Next time, will make the monetization day contain a deployment walkthrough.
- Frustration with final whiteboard interviews
  - timing, having to take time away from lab
  - "randomness" of the question you get
