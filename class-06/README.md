## Feedback Review

### The Good/The Most Helpful

- "Michelle's lectures"
  - Code review is really helpful: "struggling through lab, then carefully examining how it went", and getting "gold standard" examples (or close to it)
  - Also the LinkedList exercise
  - Promptness of lecture: glad to know it's helpful!
  - <3
- Whiteboarding/code challenges
  - Awesome! That will continue!
- So much instructional staff to help
  - And some specific kudos for each of Michelle, Nicholas, and Jeff
  - <3

### The Bad/The Least Helpful

- Learning to look up new information is a struggle.
  - For sure.
  - This is something that hurts more right now, so that you're better prepared for the future.
  - Keep asking questions!
- Journals with same prompts as 201/301
  - Then let's change it!
  - If you prefer, on any day's journal, you may instead use the generic retrospective prompt that is linked from the course syllabus.
