## Feedback Review

- Least helpful is all reading comments & learning journals
- Last week, some people felt excited for building servers and liked it, while other people felt like Spring was holding them back and it was a slog
    - you're all correct!
- Career coaching workshop was helpful (hooray!) but some of the assignments could be retooled (feedback passed along!)
- A few of you feeling like you're really struggling on DS&A, but also making progress
    - keep making progress together
